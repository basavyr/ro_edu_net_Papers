\title{\texttt{pyxrootd} \& C++ Declarative API \\within \texttt{XROOTD}}
\author{Robert Poenaru, Micha≈Ç Simon}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
A brief description of the \texttt{xrootd} architecture and its purpose within the WLCG group, together with an overview of the server- and client- sides of the xrootd framework are provided within the present work. The client side of xrootd has a relatively new implementation called Declarative API. Its main purpose is to provide the user an asyncrhonous interface that is more inline with the modern C++ paradigm. A focus on the development workflow for this API is given. Moreover, the \texttt{pyxrootd} package, which provides a python interface with the xrootd client, is also discussed and tested in a usual file-operation usecase.
