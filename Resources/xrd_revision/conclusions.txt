In the present work, a detailed overview of the XRootD framework was given, together with its major importance within the WLCG group and the High Energy Physics community. A short description of the architecture for both the server-side as well as the client-side was discussed. The asynchronous behavior of the XrdCl API which is written in C++ has been reviewed, with the latest features and release. Furthermore, a special focus was given on the File and FileSystem objects within the XRootD client. The asynchronous APIâ€™s importance in terms of usage has been mentioned and also the drawbacks in terms of code complexity. Subsequently, a discussion was made on the Declarative API, which is built on top of the existing XrdCl asynchronous API, with its main feature being the ease of use from a code-logistic standpoint. The Declarative API was adopted in the implementation of an Erasure Coding plug-in inside the XRootD client. It is showed that Declarative API is an efficient tool in providing an asynchronous C++ interface for the user while keeping a clear and concise workflow.
